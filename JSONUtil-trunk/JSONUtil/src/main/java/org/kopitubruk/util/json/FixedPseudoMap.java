/**
 * This class implements a fake map of fixed size that doesn't do any real
 * mapping. Its purpose is to provide an ordered collection of key-value pairs
 * via the entrySet() method so that it can be used to build JSON objects using
 * the same code that builds them from real maps. It is meant to be faster than
 * doing normal put and iteration operations and to save memory compared to
 * normal maps. The gains tend to be effectively marginal but they are
 * measurable with objects that have large numbers of fields to be serialized.
